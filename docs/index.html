	<h1>What's this</h1>
	<p>
		This is a collection of column-staggered and ortholinear ergonomic keyboards.
	</p><p>
		It is not as large as some other collections, but you can sort and filter the keyboards.
	</p>
	<details>
		<summary>"The rules"</summary>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Column-staggered and ortholinear keyboards only.<br>
				This avoids some ambiguity with counting columns and similar.
			</li><li>
				Keyboards have to be buildable or obtainable in some way - no teasers.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
	<details>
		<summary>A keyboard is missing!</summary>
		<p>
			Please fill out and submit keyboards using the above editor -
			I try to add interesting keyboards when I encounter them,
			but there are hundreds of open-source keyboards alone so help is always welcome.
		</p><p>
			Generally it takes a few minutes (or even less if you made the thing and know the specifics) to fill out the metadata for a keyboard.
		</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>Something's wrong / amiss about a keyboard</summary>
		<p>
			You can submit corrections as simple notes
			or by loading an existing keyboard in the above editor, making edits, and submitting the updated JSON.
		</p><p>
			Personally I tend to go over 5-10 keyboards at a time based on readily available information,
			so if something cannot be derived from the description, photos, or part list, I won't be filling that out.
		</p><p>
			And if you make open-source hardware and are reading this,
			if you do not have a part list/feature list in your repo,
			please at least mention whether the keyboard is made for hotswap sockets or not,
			and the switch type(s) if it's not just MX.
			The reader shouldn't have to look at KiCAD files .
		</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>Can you add a column?</summary>
		<p>
			I can generally add additional columns to the table so long as it's something that:
		</p><ul><li>
			Can be easily derived
		</li><li>
			Is of value to the average reader
		</li><li>
			Appears on more than just a couple keyboards
		</li></ul><p>
			Bonus points if you're willing to go over the existing keyboards
			and add a new bit of metadata to them yourself.
		</p><p>
			Some examples:
		</p><ul><li>
			Microcontroller type could be valuable,
			but is not commonly mentioned in open-source projects -
			you might recognize from a photo or guess based on slot size,
			but otherwise you'd have to look at the source files.
		</li><li>
			Splay could have been measured in degrees, but this adds a
			bunch of columns and a certain amount of overhead
			(in measuring angles between columns) when going over keyboards with splay.
		</li><li>
			Measuring tilt and tenting is problematic, but kind of important for unibody keyboards,
			so that gets a pass.
		</li></ul>
